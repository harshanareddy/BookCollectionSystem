# BookCollectionSystem
A charming Java-based command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help book worms like me organize, track, and update their personal library! 

This project lets users add books with meaningful details like genre, rating, angsty vibes, and whether they’d reread it. 
Built with pure Java and a love for storytelling, it's my way of blending tech with the comfort of books.

**Features**
1. Add books with title, author, pages, rating, genre, and a short description
2. Tag books as angsty and track re-read status
3. Search, update, and remove books by title
4. Display your full shelf or filter by:
   a.Angsty books
   b.Re-readable books
5. CLI-style prompts with a soft, personalized tone

**Tech Stack**
1. Java
2. OOP (Classes, Enums, Methods)
3. Scanner class for input
4. Command-line interface

**Why I Built This**
As a passionate reader of emotional and thoughtful stories, I wanted a cozy space where I could track the books that truly left a mark on me. 
This app reflects that sentiment — it's not just functional, it's me.
